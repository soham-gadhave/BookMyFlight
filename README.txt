BookMyFlight: AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM
========================================

BookMyFlight is a website for searching flights from one location to another, booking tickets and canceling booked tickets in real time. This website was built as a mini project for Web Technology Course in K.J Somaiya College of Engineering by Soham Gadhave (roll number: 1711077) and Mohammed Arshan Jada (roll number 1711083). The objective behind building this project was to learn how the frontend and backend of website works and more importantly learn programming languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, etc. The reason behind this topic is that we had no knowledge about web technology prior to the selection of the project topic, so we took most common topic like airline reservation system so that we can get as much help as possible.

Other technical Details can be found in the report of this project.
